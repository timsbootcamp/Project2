# trivia-twist - 'Mind-Twisting Trivia!'

We built a single page React application for a Trivia Quiz as our group final project for the edX Front-End Web Development course. The quiz offers users a fun and interactive experience, with thoughtfully selected questions from different categories and difficulty levels. The app also features animations and sound effects to make it more exciting. After finishing the quiz, users can enter their name to see how they rank on the leaderboard, making it competitive and engaging.

## FAQs

>*What was our team's motivation?*

Our team was motivated by the learning experience working in a team and with the shared goal of enhancing our web development skills and advancing our careers.


>*Why we built this project?*

Building the applciation allowed us to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application of React, Javascript and CSS.

>*What problem did this project solve?*

The React application for the Trivia Quiz solves the problem of creating an enjoyable and engaging experience for Trivia enthusiasts. 

>*What did we learn?*

We learned about how to plan for the successful development of an interactive single-page application in React. Our objectives were initially laid out, conducted research on the Trivia API, established coding standards, and developed skills for creating prototypes using wireframes. GitHub Project Kanban allowed issues to be raised (Story Points: Low, Medium, and High) and assigned to various members of the team. Based on the issues we raised, we followed Agile Development principles by focusing on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and delivering the most basic working application, then enhancing it. Daily Standup practice became a habit for us, where each of us discussed what we had achieved in the last day, work to be done next, and issues that were experienced in case someone else from the team could assist


#### Back End Team
Responsible for creating the back end logic, making use of available API ensuring they worked correctly and were integrated successfully, managing data storage and the performance of the system. It is pretty much everything behind the scenes to make the front end functional.


#### Front End Team
Focussed on designing prototypes of our logo and web page designs, building the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the application. The Front End Team role also worked on the
React component code.

Overall, we further built up upon our skills that we have learnt in the entire edX Front-End Web Development course. Yes, it was hardwork, but we also learnt to have some fun too! All the above will help us to work successfully in a commercial environment.



> What makes our project stand out? 

Our project truly stands out because we've put in a lot of effort to make it great. It shines brightly because we've been dedicated to making sure everything about it is excellent. From the planning stages to the design and programming, we've followed top-notch practices every step of the way.


We have applied the principles of Separation of Concern to the entire project and this includes assigning every person a separate task and this includes separating the React application into
various components with separate javascript and css files. In the React and Javascript coding, we ensured that each function did one thing and did it well. The code is readable and maintainable. 

As a group, we pushed ourselves continually ensuring our work was of the highest quality.
